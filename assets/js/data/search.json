What is AUTOSAR? Why Automotive Industry Uses It AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) is a standardized software architecture for automotive ECUs. It enables modularity, reusability, and scalability across multiple vehicles and suppliers. Key Goals: Standardized interfaces between software components and hardware. Vendor-independent software modules. Faster integration and reduced development cost. Support for safety-critical automotive applications. 2. AUTOSAR Architecture Overview (Layered Architecture) AUTOSAR Classic follows a layered architecture: Application Layer: Contains Software Components (SWCs) implementing ECU functionality. Runtime Environment (RTE): Middleware that handles communication between SWCs and BSW. Basic Software (BSW): Hardware abstraction and services such as MCAL, ECU Abstraction, Services Layer. Microcontroller Abstraction Layer (MCAL): Direct interface to microcontroller peripherals. This separation improves reusability and ensures software is hardware-independent. 3. AUTOSAR Terminologies (ECU, SWC, BSW, RTE) ECU (Electronic Control Unit) – The hardware running the software. SWC (Software Component) – Logical unit of functionality; modular and reusable. BSW (Basic Software) – Provides services, drivers, and hardware abstraction. RTE (Runtime Environment) – Middleware connecting SWCs with each other and the BSW. Other common terms: ARXML – XML format describing SWCs, ports, interfaces, and BSW configurations. Runnable – Executable function inside an SWC triggered by events. 4. AUTOSAR Classic Platform – High-Level Overview Modular design for multiple ECUs in a vehicle. Supports safety, diagnostics, and standard communication protocols. Uses ARXML files for software description and configuration. Toolchain-heavy: often requires Vector DaVinci Configurator and Developer. 5. Benefits &amp; Drawbacks of AUTOSAR Benefits: Standardized platform across OEMs and suppliers. Reusable software modules for different vehicles. Scalable for multiple ECU variants. Facilitates safety compliance (ISO 26262). Drawbacks: Steep learning curve for beginners. Requires specialized tools for configuration and code generation. Extra overhead for simple ECUs. Integration of multiple modules can be complex. 6. AUTOSAR Versions &amp; Releases (Classic Platform) Classic Platform 4.x is widely used. Each release introduces: New BSW modules Improvements in RTE Enhanced safety and diagnostic features Releases maintain backward compatibility but may require configuration updates. 7. AUTOSAR Compliance &amp; Conformance Ensures software modules adhere to AUTOSAR specifications. Guarantees interoperability between OEMs, Tier-1 suppliers, and software providers. Checked via conformance tests and ARXML validation tools. Helps in certification for functional safety (ISO 26262). 8. AUTOSAR Use Cases in Real ECUs AUTOSAR Classic is applied in multiple automotive domains: Powertrain Control – Engine and transmission ECUs ADAS Modules – Advanced Driver Assistance Systems Infotainment – Audio, navigation, and vehicle interface ECUs Gateway ECUs – CAN/LIN/FlexRay communication routing Body Electronics – Lighting, HVAC, seat control This post gives you a solid foundation of AUTOSAR Classic. Next, you can dive into Software Components (SWC), Runtime Environment (RTE), and Basic Software (BSW) in more advanced posts." }, { "title": "AUTOSAR CAN Signal Processing", "url": "/posts/autosar-project/", "categories": "AUTOSAR, CAN", "tags": "autosar, vector, can", "date": "2026-01-11 00:00:00 +0000", "content": "🚘 Project Overview Implemented CAN signal reception and processing using AUTOSAR Classic (Vector MICROSAR). 🔧 Features CAN Rx/Tx handling Signal timeout &amp; validation Application logic triggered on signal reception 🛠 Tools Used DaVinci Configurator CANoe Embedded C" } ]
